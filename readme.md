## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to download and install all the dependencies.

You need a PostgreSQL database, if you already have one, you can put your credentials in the .env file in the DB_... section.  If you do not have one, you can use [docker](https://www.docker.com/). The docker-compose.yml is given in the root directory.

### Installing

To get a development env running, install all the dependencies with:
```cmd
composer install && npm install
```
Don't forget to edit your .env file. If you do not have one:
```cmd
cp .env.example .env
``` 
And modify your credentials.
Then generate your jwt key and your app key
```cmd
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret
```

If you don't have a PostgreSQL you can start the docker-compose.yml file is included up in the root directory
```cmd
docker-compose up
```
To start your PHP server use the command (*by default the server will start on localhost:8000*):
```cmd
php artisan serve
```
You can specify a port by using 
```cmd
php artisan serve --port=8080
```
Or you can simply run the launchscript.sh with:
```cmd
./launchscript.sh
```
If it doesn't work, it probably means you have to set the right to execute it.
```cmd
sudo chmod +x launchscript.sh
```

## Deployment

The project is ready to deploy on heroku, just push this repo to your herokuapp repository.
Add you addon for the database with the following :
```cmd
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```
Don't forget to edit the configs with:
 * APP_ENV  =  production
 * APP_KEY
 * APP_URL = your url
 * DB_CONNECTION = heroku
 * JWT_SECRET
 * MAIL_PASSWORD
 * MAIL_USERNAME

 And finally run in the console of your heroku app:
 ```cmd
 php artisan migrate:fresh
 ```
to set your database
